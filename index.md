## Introduction

Mygeopackage is designed for data mining and machine learning in GIS. The package provides basic tools to deal with common spatial data like GeoJSON or ESRI shapefile, and also tools to perform data processing and machine learning.

The package is based on Scikit-Learn module. Currently, the package supports three modules: data preprocessing, unsupervised machine learning and data mining.

The package also offers the functionality of interactive web map and GUI interface. The GUI interface is good for exploring spatial data and experiment on machine learning algorithms.
